# AI4FM Website

Source for [ai4fm.cs.luc.edu](https://ai4fm.cs.luc.edu), the AI for Formal Methods research group at Loyola University Chicago.

## Local development

Requires Python 3.13 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```sh
uv sync
make build-site
make serve
```

The preview is served at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Both local development and GitHub Pages use Sphinx's `dirhtml` builder so page URLs stay consistent.

## Content

- `src/papers/`: one source file per paper, presentation, poster, or artifact. Keep the existing title and `Status`, `Venue`, `Authors`, and `DOI / PDF` fields. Each source becomes its own page.
- `src/posts/`: one source file per news post. Use the existing `blogpost`, `date` (for example `June 5, 2026`), `author`, `category`, and `tags` fields.
- `src/pages/`: team, software, about, funding, and participation pages.

The homepage discovers every paper and news post at build time. News is sorted newest first. Research follows the order in `src/papers/index.rst`, with new unlisted papers appended automatically. The homepage lists existing titles and metadata without generating copy.

Use Sphinx `:doc:` links for internal pages and `:download:` links for downloadable files; these survive changes in page depth and news excerpts.

## Design

`src/_themes/ai4fm/` contains the shared layout and stylesheet. The theme uses the selected maroon-and-paper design, the compact `ai4fm @ luc.edu` header, the Computer Science site's Open Sans and Antenna heading stack, and 100 ms hover feedback. Reduced-motion preferences disable transitions. Fonts have local fallbacks.

The root `index.html` opens the generated homepage after a build. Use `make serve` to browse the complete site locally.

## Verification

```sh
make check-site
```

This builds with warnings treated as errors and checks generated internal links and
anchors, copied visual assets, shared page structure, and complete homepage coverage
of papers and news.

SEO metadata, canonical URLs, the sitemap, and `robots.txt` are generated with the
site. The check also confirms that every public source page is represented exactly
once in the sitemap and has one concise description; the CI deployment uses the
same check before publishing.

## Deployment

The existing GitHub Actions workflow builds and deploys `build/` to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to `main`, or when the workflow is run manually. Local previewing does not publish changes.
